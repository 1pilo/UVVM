# Getting started using UVVM

UVVM is Free and Open source, under the very flexible [MIT licence](https://github.com/UVVM/UVVM/blob/master/LICENSE)

## For developers with no previous UVVM experience: 1
You should start by first understanding and trying out the Utility Library. The basics here could be covered in less than one hour. The UVVM Utility Library has a *very* low user threshold - according to all users so far.
* Read the [README-file for UVVM Utility Library](https://github.com/UVVM/UVVM/blob/master/README_UVVM_Utility_Library.md) to get a first introduction to why, what and how.
* Go through the powerpoint 'Making a simple, structured and efficient VHDL testbench â€“ Step-by-step' linked to from the README-file

## For developers with no previous UVVM experience: 2
Run the demo-testbench provided with the utility library
